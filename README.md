# MavenDocker-NullProject :whale:
## NullTeam's maven project, presenting docker monitoring.
This project monitors a Docker Cluster and keeps track of all measurements made inside the Cluster    
by storing them in a database. It also provides a simple Graphical User Interface through which the user can   
see the Docker Cluster and interact with it with several actions on both Docker Instances and Docker Images:  
‚úîÔ∏è **start - stop - rename - restart - pause - unpause - kill - remove - show logs - show subnet**  
‚úîÔ∏è **pull - implement - remove**
